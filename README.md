## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [YES] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [NO] UI animations
* [NO] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [NO] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [NO] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This was the first time I coded in Swift and my first time building an iOS app. Naturally, everything was new to me and I
took some time to get used to the environment. Adding the settings activity was the hardest part for me as storing a value
in the device itself was hard to code. I tried my best to get the text field above the keyboard, but in the end I was able 
to accomplish that. Instead, I worked hard on the UI and ended up with a satisfactory result. I'm sure I can do better with 
some more practice.
